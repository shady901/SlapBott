Idle Hunters
-----------------------------
Bot Mechanics:
* Raidbosses for each server creating a channel when they spawn, This will be a 24 hour per turn system so that debufs and buffs will get applied and removed correctly
* War Mechanic, my idea is that a channel or more than one will spawn, it will generate enemies if an enemy doesnt get put in combat with a player,
  ild like it to attack a "Server Health Bar", if the server health bar goes down it punish players or township systems, but on the other end if you win the war being,
  the enemy health bar (this is probibly lowered by each kill) gets to 0, it will reward the players handsomely
* Some form of Idle resource gathering, through sending an alt away or hiring (mainly for crafting or gold or a rare currency with a different function(maybe combining items))
* A DND explore system that is psudo random where people say i want to explore, 
  game returns you have found this and gives options on what you can do,
  this can lead to finding unique raid or unlocking them for the server, or a bunch of other rewards or fights
* An acheivments (Horizontal Progression) for the whole user which applies rewards to all characters 
* Some form of dungeon spawn (either being spawned by a mechanic or just /startdungeon), i would like this to be party play and or solo 
* a quest or job board where you can choose a passive quest to do, this can be forplayer driven quests, this could be kill amount of dragons to collect this amount of item type
* Township system per server this includes Inn services such as heals for gold or somthing
  
-----------------------------
Turn based system
* Speed Based System, with base of 1, so if somone has "fast turn speed" being 0.5 they will attack twice that turn the same is for
  if somone has 2 Turn Speed it takes two turns to move
* For raid we need to find or hard code the slowest attack speed (keep in mind slows) so that raid have proper balance with Turn Speed
* Front Line Back line Based on skill used this will only occur in raids or boss encounters
*
*
*
*
*
*
-----------------------------
RaidBosses
* Base the boss's defence mechanics and or Health off of Item Levels 
* Damage can be based off item level or Max HP
* Punishment for player: They drop all items and are put in raid boss pool if the boss has been defeated
* Maybe have Conditions to hit boss
* Front Line Back line Effecting Skills 
* Condition for min player count 
-----------------------------
Idle Mechanics
* default farming location, unlocking more with explore based on the regions you explore in 
* this should be you just send away a character for this amount of time and somthing happens it could be that you farmed or gathered 
  resources this should help with proffesions in some way or something unique occured
* gathering types could be chopping mining gathering(herbs) Enchanting(consumes resources to gather/make crafting mats)
*
*
*
-----------------------------
Explore Mechanic
* Based on Regions/Locations (they have recommended Level as some locations have worse encounters)
  Example: Badlands has more Combat encounters overall at blah blah level
* 
* 
* 
* Npc encounters, some with options to bring To server Township
* Caches/Rewards/Traps
* Outcomes can lead to RaidBoss Spawning in location Area in server, or dungeon for player then can invite party
-----------------------------
Dungeons
* dungeons should be found during the explore mechanic, and pop up as a hidden channel for the player that found it, this should allow for invites as its recommended for 1-4
* if you die in the dungeon your gear will be droped in the position you died in, and can be aquired when any play come accross it 
* i want to have a map system(grid) that is generated, i would like players to move around as well as mobs
* i would like to have a boss that its diffculty is based on total Ilevel/playerlevel in the dungeon so thats its difficult for 1-2 players and moderate for 3-4
* i would like some dungeons in regions to have a chance drop specific gear(uniques)
-----------------------------

* Potential Generation per item

* affix's are Based on Rarety and Ilevel
* Prefix's are Stats Example: Str, Dex, Int, Crit, +%dmg type 
* Suffux's are Stats Example: critdmg, effects, Penertration types, speed
* Rareties: common, magic, rare, epic, Legendary, Unique(cant be generated as it is Manually Created for Mechanic rewards) 
* Potential amount is changed based on Rarety
* Legendarys have some special Example bonus affix, has an implicid idk what else we could make it
* affix's will be psudo random being of teir so t1 life would be lowest life t10 life will be highest ect,
  this is also affected by rarety so legendarys cant have t1 on everything
* Hidden item level to Help Generate affix's: Dropped level *5 +|- 5

Example Item - of lightning sword
******Sword Of******

Damage: 15 Flat Ligtning
TurnSpeed/attackspd: (Base 0.8)*1-(Speed Modifyer) = 0.68

* township has a job board this allows players or the town to create jobs/quests, this could be if township health is low,
  a job is created to repair the town, or to have proffession player jobs such as i need my bow to have this upgrade, or to make 10 random bows
* Township will have a health mechanic that is turned on during events such as the war mechanic, or dungeon portal spawns, after a certain period
  the town will lose health if this hits 0 the inn and banks will turn off for a period, and any Npc's aquired will be removed
