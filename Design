Idle Hunters
-----------------------------
Bot Mechanics:
* Raidbosses for each server creating a channel when they spawn, This will be a 24 hour per turn system so that debufs and buffs will get applied and removed correctly
* War Mechanic, my idea is that a channel or more than one will spawn, it will generate enemies if an enemy doesnt get put in combat with a player,
  ild like it to attack a "Server Health Bar", if the server health bar goes down it punish players or township systems, but on the other end if you win the war being,
  the enemy health bar (this is probibly lowered by each kill) gets to 0, it will reward the players handsomely
* Some form of Idle resource gathering, through sending an alt away or hiring (mainly for crafting or gold or a rare currency with a different function(maybe combining items))
* A DND explore system that is psudo random where people say i want to explore, 
  game returns you have found this and gives options on what you can do,
  this can lead to finding unique raid or unlocking them for the server, or a bunch of other rewards or fights
* An acheivments (Horizontal Progression) for the whole user which applies rewards to all characters 
* Some form of dungeon spawn (either being spawned by a mechanic or just /startdungeon), i would like this to be party play and or solo 
* a quest or job board where you can choose a passive quest to do, this can be forplayer driven quests, this could be kill amount of dragons to collect this amount of item type
* Township system per server this includes Inn services such as heals for gold or somthing
  
-----------------------------
Turn based system
* Speed Based System, with base of 1, so if somone has "fast turn speed" being 0.5 they will attack twice that turn the same is for
  if somone has 2 Turn Speed it takes two turns to move
* For raid we need to find or hard code the slowest attack speed (keep in mind slows) so that raid have proper balance with Turn Speed
* Front Line Back line Based on skill used
*

-----------------------------
RaidBosses
* Base the boss's defence mechanics and or Health off of Item Levels 
* Damage can be based off item level or Max HP
* Punishment for player: They drop all items and are put in raid boss pool if the boss has been defeated
* Maybe have Conditions to hit boss
* Front Line Back line Effecting Skills 
* Condition for min player count

* affix's will be psudo random being of teir so t1 life would be lowest life t10 life will be highest ect,
  this is also affected by rarety so legendarys cant have t1 on everything
